# User Generated Logo Creator (.svg file)

## Description

I was motivated to create this project as a need to be cost efficient and self sufficient, when it comes to creating a logo. I built this because I wanted a quick and interactive way to develop a logo, without needing the use of a graphic designer or multiple resources. It's a one stop shop. It solves the problem of being able to create multiple logo files with hardly any effort, so you can really find the logo that works for you. I learned a ton about using defining and using classes, inheritance, testing with Jest, and importing + exporting between different JS files.


## Installation

The steps to install my project are as follows:

- Clone or fork my code from GitHub
- Install the required dependencies (Inquirer & Jest (for testing))
- Run the file from the command line using "node index.js"
